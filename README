How to run:
To compile in the shell, enter: 
make
To run, enter:
./AMStartup [Number_Avatars] [Difficulty] [Server]

======TESTING======
TEST.sh is a test script to check the arguments and the basic functionality.
To run, enter TEST.sh into the terminal. A test_maze.log file will be generated
with the results of the run.

To test the code, the printShmaze function located in the diectory was run and
compared with the log.out file in pierce.cs.dartmouth.edu:/var/tmp/####
The walls were checked to make sure that no walls were discoverd that didn't exist

To ensure that getNextMove worked in every possible case, a -100 was returned which
would trigger the avatar program to quit, printing the information where the avatar
couldn't determine a next move. The png files located in pierce.cs.dartmouth.edu/
var/tmp/#### were examined at that turn to see why the avatar got stuck.

======RESULTS======

The program was run on levels 0-8 with 2-10 avatars. All runs were succesful. The
log files can be viewed in 2 folders - results0-4 which include the results on levels
0 through 4, and results5-9 which includes the results on levels 5-9. Level 9 with 2 
avatars solved, but nothing beyond Level 9, 2 Avatars would complete. The max move limit
was reached and the Maze would fail. The failed maze logs are included in the failed/
directory.
